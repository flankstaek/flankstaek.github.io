<a href="projects/spells.html">Spells</a> was an experiment in creating a turned based multiplayer wizard battle.
The core idea fueling the game was predictive 'meta' combat in as abstract and as pure of form as possible. You can play the prototype <a href="projects/spells.html">here,</a> and access the source code <a href="https://www.github.com/flankstaek/spells">here.</a>

<a href="projects/beautiful.html">Beauty</a> was an experiment based around giving an interactive medium through which poetry (or any text) could be displayed. This was done using vector images that also served as the mechanics driving the text forward and giving the user interactability. You can play the prototype <a href="projects/beautiful.html">here,</a> and access the source code <a href="https://www.github.com/flankstaek/beautiful">here.</a>

Save Something! was an attempt to make a game/game engine using the OpenGL library <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML.</a> The experiment uses retro graphics and minor random generation, as well as a self-implemented animation framework. It has a large list of dependencies and is barely playable, you can access the source code <a href="https://www.github.com/flankstaek/save-something">here,</a> where you can compile and run it for your machine if you so desire.

I also made a version of Pong in Unity. You can play that <a href="projects/pong.html">here.</a>
