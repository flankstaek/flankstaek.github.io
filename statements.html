Hey, I've made a couple game type things and they often have some sort of
artistic merit or meaning behind them. If you made it to this page then that
means you probably care at least a little about what I've made, so here's a
little blurb about each one.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<div class="links">
  ~~~~~~~~~~closeness~~~~~~~~~~
</div>
<p>
  The mechanics are meant to evoke a certain poetic meaning about the act of
  getting or being close to someone. This came from a very personal feeling
  about my family, but I think the idea can be transfered to many scenarios.
  <br>
  <br>
  It is the loss of giving, the draining of ones self for the benefit of
  others.
  <br>
  <br>
  That is the feeling I strove to capture.
</p>
<div class="links">
  ~~~~~Wake Up // Sleep Forever~~~~~
</div>
<p>
  This game was a culmination of a semester long focus on the concepts and
  the very act of sleeping. What does it mean to sleep, and how can I tap
  into that?
  <br>
  <br>
  I ended up focusing on my experience with sleep paralysis, and found the
  mechanic of helplessness very motivating. The focus on defending ones self
  from the thoughts in your head drove the mechanics behind this game.
  <br>
  <br>
  I also attempted to give this game a very strong link to a controller. With
  the mindset that a controller was a core part of the gameplay experience, and
  thus should be a core focus of the mechanics.
